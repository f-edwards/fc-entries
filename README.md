This project contains the code necessary to perform the analyses reported in FORTHCOMING CITATION.  These scripts transform individual-year level data from the Adoption and Foster Care Analysis and Reporting System (AFCARS) into state-year panel data that measure variation in state foster care systems between years.  It also depends on a series of other datasets, described in detail in the included scripts.
